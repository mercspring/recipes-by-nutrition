# Recipes by Nutrition Project

Our group's task is to create a website app where the user can search for a desired meal into an input field, and from there our API will return a list of results of recipes that the user can click on to reveal its ingredients and nutritional values. Additionally, previous searched are saved in the users search history and users can mark recipes as favorites on a list. Finally, users can paste links for recipes that they've found to obtain their nutritional value.



AS A health-conscious user interested in cooking,

I WANT to see the nutritional value of recipes for meals I want to cook

SO THAT I can choose a recipe with the highest nutritional value


GIVEN a website with form inputs where I can enter a meal

WHEN I enter a type of meal (example: lasagna)

THEN I am presented with a list of recipes for the meal

WHEN I click on a recipe

THEN I am presented with a list of ingredients and their nutritional values

WHEN I search for a new recipe

THEN my previous searches are saved in the search history

WHEN I mark a recipe as a favorite/one I want to save

THEN the recipe will be saved in a list I can access

WHEN I paste in the link for a recipe I have found

THEN I will see the nutritional information for that recipe
