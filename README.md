# Recipes by Nutrition Project


## Introduction 

The website app our group created allows a user to enter a desired meal into a search input field, which will return a list of recipes (results) that the user can then click on to display an image of the meal, ingredients, nutritional value, and cooking instructions. Any previous searches are saved in the users search history and can also be added to a "favorites" section on a list. 


## Instructions

WHEN I enter a type of meal (example: lasagna)

THEN I am presented with a list of recipes for the meal.

WHEN I click on a recipe

THEN I am presented with a list of ingredients, their nutritional values, and cooking instructions.

WHEN I search for a new recipe

THEN my previous searches are saved in the search history.

WHEN I mark a recipe as a favorite/one I want to save

THEN the recipe will be saved in a list I can access.
