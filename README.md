# Recipes by Nutrition Project

AS A health-conscious user interested in cooking,

I WANT to see the nutritional value of recipes for meals I want to cook

SO THAT I can choose a recipe with the highest nutritional value


GIVEN a website with form inputs where I can enter a meal

WHEN I enter a type of meal (example: lasagna)

THEN I am presented with a list of recipes for the meal

WHEN I click on a recipe

THEN I am presented with a list of ingredients and their nutritional values

WHEN I search for a new recipe

THEN my previous searches are saved in the search history

WHEN I mark a recipe as a favorite/one I want to save

THEN the recipe will be saved in a list I can access

WHEN I paste in the link for a recipe I have found

THEN I will see the nutritional information for that recipe
